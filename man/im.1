.SH NAME
.PP
im - invoice-maker, a terminal user interface program to create and
manage invoices.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]im\f[R] [\f[I]-C\f[R]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]im\f[R] is a go program that\[cq]s meant to manage company data and
past invoices as well as save them in specified directory.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\f[B]-c\f[R] \f[I]dir\f[R], \f[B]-C\f[R] \f[I]dir\f[R], \f[B]--config-dir=\f[BI]dir\f[B]\f[R]
Specifies config file directory.
By default we use \f[V]$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/invoice-maker\f[R].
Files like \f[V]config.yml\f[R], \f[V]template.md\f[R] and
\f[V]template-row.md\f[R] are required for application to run smoothly.
.TP
\f[B]-i\f[R] \f[I]dir\f[R], \f[B]-I\f[R] \f[I]dir\f[R], \f[B]--invoice-dir=\f[BI]dir\f[B]\f[R]
Specifies invoices directory.
By default we use \f[V]$XDG_DATA_HOME/invoice-maker\f[R].
Folder structure inside it has been arbitrary set to
\f[V]year/month/your_invoice_name.pdf\f[R] but that might be a subject
for change in future.
.SH FILES
.PP
\f[B]im\f[R] uses following files and they are expected to land in
\f[V]$XDG_CONFIG_HOME\f[R] (unless -c option says otherwise).
If any of these files is not there, it will be generated from defaults
stored most likely at \f[V]/etc/invoice-maker\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]config.yml\f[R]
Stores all the data about past receipent and the issuer to make
generation process just a dropdown pick.
It also stores all the generated invoices for historical purposes in
case you loose your files.
Made that way to be able to archive the memory and move between machines
easily.
More about config structure in section five \f[B]im(5)\f[R]
.TP
\f[B]template.md\f[R]
Defines main invoice template.
You can scrap out things you don\[cq]t need (i.e.\ your country has no
vat rate for your services and it serves no purpose) or adjust it for
your needs.
The most important part are square braces which define variable names
and space left to print them.
Overall on very early stages it was assumed that the template should not
be modified in terms of number of characters per line, therefore if you
keep too little space for variables, they will be cut off.
More about templates in section five \f[B]im(5)\f[R].
.TP
\f[B]template-row.md\f[R]
Same as \f[V]template.md\f[R], adjustable definition of a single row of
an invoice.
More about templates in section five \f[B]im(5)\f[R].
